This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Todo's 


In this project, I intend to achieve the following:

### `Build a basic React app using npm start`

I plan to use this app as the basis for future experiments using React for my exploration of frontend and
mobile design.

This creates and runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `Develop basic tests and run npm test`

I plan to use this project to learn the basics of testing react applications.

### `Host this sample site and run npm build`

I plan to deploy this application as a demonstration of my react skills. 

Further development of this application would involve connecting this application to Wechat as a learning project for
creating mobile apps on Wechat.

### `Enable css components by running npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. I used `eject`, to enable css components!**


## Further documentation for React application can be found below.

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
