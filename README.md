## Todo's 


In this project, I intend to achieve the following:

### `Build a basic React app using npm start`

I plan to use this app as the basis for future experiments using React for my exploration of frontend and
mobile design.


### `Develop a basic react app`

I plan to use this project to learn the basics of testing react applications.

### `Host this sample site and run npm build`

I plan to deploy this application as a demonstration of my react skills. 

Further development of this application would involve connecting this application to Wechat as a learning project for
creating mobile apps on Wechat.
